# Reverse-Sound-Wave
This was one of the first project I did in my Data Structure and Algorithms class. In this project our task was to reverse a sound wave using the stack data structure. Stack was a perfect choice for this task as it follows first-in-last-out pattern. In this project I successfully implemented Stack in java and was able to run it with my sound wave and reversed it.
